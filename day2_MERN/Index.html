        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born in the year 1887 in Tamilnadu. He was a splendid Indian mathematician who gets credited even today for his commitments in the field of maths. George S. Carr’s book, ‘Synopsis of elementary results in pure mathematics, became his inspiration to follow his passion. Today, Ramanujan mathematician, remembered for inventions of important equations, the infinite series of π, and game theory. The year 1914 was the defining moment in the striving life of the virtuoso mathematician. G.H.Hardy, the great mathematician, invited him to Cambridge. In 1916, he was granted his PhD by the institution. Ramanujan died at an early age because of Tuberculosis in 1920.
        <h2>Bhaskara I</h2>

        <p>Bhaskara, the 7th-century famous Indian mathematician, was born in c.600 and died in CE 680. He is one of the ancient Indian mathematicians who is known for his contribution to maths. Bhaskara mathematician is famous for inventing the Hindu decimal system. This Aryabhata follower wrote a critique, ‘Aryabhatiyabhasya’ in CE 629, which is considered the oldest known Sanskrit language work in the mathematics & astronomy field. In addition, his other works include Mahabhaskariya and Laghubhāskarīya. Mahabhaskariya comprises 8 chapters, dwelling on mathematical astronomy. The book discusses the relationship between cosine and sine and gives the sin x approximation formula. The book likewise examines about longitudes of the planets, conjunctions of the planets with one another and with eclipses of the sun & the moon, shining stars, the lunar crescent, risings and settings.</p>
        <h2>Aryabhatta</h2>    
        <img src="https://motion.ac.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aryabhatta.jpeg">
        <p>476-550 CE, the golden period of India in which Aryabhatta, the scientist, astronomer and mathematician, lived. Aryabhatta, Indian mathematician’s contributions include the discovery of the spherical shape of the earth, the number of days in 1 year and notable works are Aryabhatasiddhanta and Aryabhatiya. Ganita (Mathematics): This section has the names of the first 10 decimal places and provides algorithms for finding cube and square roots through decimals. In this second, he noticed the second-order sine difference and sine numbers are proportional. Aryabhatta is known for involving one of the two strategies for making the table of sines by utilizing the Pythagorean hypothesis.
            Aryabhatiya has three sections. These sections are:
            Kala-kriya (Time Calculations): Aryabhata examines cosmology like planetary movements, meanings of different units of time so forth.
            Gola (Sphere): In this section, the mathematician used trigonometry for spherical geometry.</p>
        <h2>Shakuntala Devi</h2>

        <p>Shakuntala Devi was born in Bangalore in 1929 and was known as a ‘human computer’ because of her exceptional calculation skills. She travelled across the world showcasing her mathematical genius and winning international acclaim. In 1977, she calculated the 23rd root of a 201-digit number at Southern Methodist University. Remarkably, she did this in 50 seconds, outpacing a computer. In 1980, she multiplied two 13 digit numbers chosen at random by Imperial College London in 28 seconds. This gave her a place in the 1982 Guinness Book of World Records. She included many of her mathematical tricks in her 1977 book Figuring: The Joy of Numbers. She died on 21st April, 2013 aged 83 due to multiple health complications and was undoubtedly one of the most prodigious women mathematicians in India.</p>
        <h2>Raman Parimala</h2>

        <p>Raman Parimala is an eminent woman mathematician of India who currently serves as a professor of mathematics at Emory University, Georgia. She has significantly contributed to the study of algebra. For her exemplary work she has been honoured with the Bhatnagar Prize in 1987, an honorary doctorate from the University of Lausanne in 1999, the Srinivasa Ramanujan Birth Centenary Award in 2003 and the TWAS Prize for mathematics in 2005.</p>
        <h2>Sujatha Ramdorai</h2>

        <p>Sujatha Ramdorai is a professor of mathematics and an algebraic number theorist. She is best known for her work on the non-commutative version of the Iwasawa theory, originally developed by the great Japanese mathematician Kenkichi Iwasawa. She is part of many prominent international research agencies like the Banff International Research Station and the Indo-French Centre for Promotion of Advanced Research.Miss Ramdorai was also a member of the National Knowledge Commission from 2007 to 2009. She has been awarded with the ICTP Ramanujan Prize in 2006, the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 2004, and the Krieger-Nelson Prize in 2020. The government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri award in 2023 in the field of science and engineering.</p>
